## Gameplay Showcase

![Legend Festival: Cross Event gameplay screen](docs/images/gameplay-showcase.png)

**Legend Festival: Cross Event** centers on the **Battle and Collect** loop. The player enters from the main menu, reads the active objective and pressure state, performs the core action, banks rewards, then returns through roadmap and retention goals.

- **Primary flow:** Main menu -> Start Game -> Gameplay objective -> Complete Action -> Reward bank -> Level roadmap -> Return loops.
- **Level design:** 8-stage progression from `L1 Onboarding: Win the encounter: Learn the core action` to `L8 Repeatable Loop: Win the encounter: Return for a harder run and better reward`.
- **Pacing:** difficulty `1 -> 3.15`, rewards `50g/20xp -> 525g/240xp`, pressure `5 -> 19`.
- **Unlock cadence:** tutorial complete, daily quest, upgrade option, booster, collection slot.
- **Meta progression:** DailyQuest, Achievement, BattlePass, Gacha, Collection, Progression.
- **Verification:** Fun E2E, level balancing, and Flutter analyze are covered by the game-loop verification suite.
